# Domain Name Registry (Mini ENS)

## 🏷 Project Title
Domain Name Registry (Mini ENS)

## 📌 Project Description
This project implements a simplified Ethereum Name Service (ENS)-style registry on the blockchain. Users can register human-readable names, link them to an owner address, renew expired names, and transfer ownership securely through smart contract interactions.

## 🎯 Project Vision
To enable a decentralized, censorship-resistant naming system where identity and ownership of domain-like identifiers are stored transparently on-chain and controlled entirely by users.

## 🚀 Key Features
✅ Register a unique domain name  
✅ Automatic expiration based on duration  
✅ Renew domain ownership anytime  
✅ Transfer domain to another wallet  
✅ Check availability before registering  
✅ On-chain ownership verification  

## 🔮 Future Scope
🔹 Marketplace for buying/selling domains  
🔹 Bidding & auction system for premium names  
🔹 Subdomain support (e.g., app.name.eth)  
🔹 IPFS / content hash mapping  
🔹 ENS-compatible resolution system  
🔹 Front-end DApp with wallet integration
